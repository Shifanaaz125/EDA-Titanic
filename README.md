# Problem Statment
1) The objective of this study is to analyze the people-related trends present in the Titanic datasets in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of various aspects. Firstly, we aim to explore the number of survivors and delve deeper into their characteristics, including age and class distribution. By examining these factors, we seek to uncover patterns and insights that shed light on the demographics of the survivors aboard the Titanic.
2) Furthermore, an essential aspect of our investigation involves investigating the ratio of male to female genders among the survivors. This analysis will provide valuable information regarding the gender composition of the survivor population and offer insights into potential gender-related disparities in survival rates.
3) By delving into these facets of the Titanic datasets, our study aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the people-related dynamics surrounding the Titanic disaster, offering valuable insights into the number of survivors, their age and class distribution, as well as the gender ratio among the survivors.

# Analytical Summary
**The project titled "The Titanic Dataset Analysis" aims to analyze various people-related trends in the Titanic dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of different aspects related to the survivors. The analysis focuses on exploring the number of survivors and their characteristics, such as age and class distribution. Additionally, the gender composition among the survivors is investigated to uncover potential gender-related disparities in survival rates.**

**The project begins by importing the required libraries and loading the Titanic dataset. The dataset is then examined, including its shape, data types of columns, and unique values in each column. It is observed that there are missing values in the 'Cabin,' 'Embarked,' and 'Age' columns, which are subsequently handled by filling or removing the missing values.**

1. A statistical summary of the dataset is provided, indicating that the average survival rate is 38%. The analysis proceeds with data visualization to further explore the dataset. The distribution of passengers across different age groups is visualized using a histogram, showing that the majority of passengers fall between the ages of 25 and 35.

2. The gender ratio among the passengers is depicted through a pie chart, revealing that male passengers constitute 64.8% of the total population, while female passengers account for 35.2%.

3. The project investigates the age groups of the surviving passengers by creating a bar graph. It is observed that the majority of survivors belong to the youth age group. A comparison is also made between the age groups of survived and perished passengers, showing that the death rate among children is relatively low compared to other age groups.

4. The analysis then focuses on exploring the passenger class distribution. A bar graph illustrates the count of passengers in each class, indicating that the majority were in the third class, followed by the first class and the second class with the fewest passengers.

5. The dataset's 'Embarked' column, representing the port of embarkation, is analyzed next. The count of passengers from different cities is shown, and a pie chart demonstrates the distribution. It reveals that the majority of passengers (72.3%) boarded the Titanic from Southampton (S).

*Overall, the analysis of the Titanic dataset provides insights into the demographics of the survivors, including their age distribution, gender composition, class distribution, and the cities they embarked from. The project contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the people-related dynamics surrounding the Titanic disaster.*
